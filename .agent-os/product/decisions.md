## 2025-08-05: Initial Agent OS Installation for Existing Project

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Process
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Install Agent OS into existing SBV Professional V2 codebase to provide structured development workflow management and comprehensive project documentation.

### Context

The SBV Professional V2 project has significant functionality already implemented but needs better project organization, structured development workflows, and comprehensive documentation to support ongoing development and maintenance.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Continue with current ad-hoc development approach**
   - Pros: No change required, familiar workflow
   - Cons: Lack of structure, unclear priorities, difficult to track progress

2. **Implement custom project management system**
   - Pros: Tailored to specific needs
   - Cons: Time-intensive, reinventing the wheel, no proven methodology

### Rationale

Agent OS provides proven structured approach to software development with clear documentation patterns, spec-driven development, and task management that will improve development velocity and code quality.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear development priorities and roadmap visibility
- Structured approach to feature development with specs and tasks
- Consistent documentation patterns across all development work
- Better collaboration through standardized workflows

**Negative:**
- Initial time investment to set up and learn Agent OS patterns
- Need to adapt existing development habits to new workflow

## 2025-07-29: Swiss Corporate Design Pixel-Perfect Implementation

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Design Team, Frontend Developer, Product Owner

### Decision

Implement Swiss Corporate Design system with pixel-perfect accuracy using custom CSS variables and TailwindCSS utility classes, maintaining exact visual match to V1 demo specifications.

### Context

Swiss banking institutions require strict adherence to corporate design standards for regulatory and brand compliance. The V1 demo established visual benchmarks that must be maintained.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Generic UI framework customization**
   - Pros: Faster initial development
   - Cons: Difficult to achieve pixel-perfect match, ongoing customization overhead

2. **Complete custom CSS implementation**
   - Pros: Full control over design
   - Cons: Higher development overhead, more maintenance

### Rationale

Hybrid approach using TailwindCSS for utilities with custom Swiss design variables provides optimal balance of development speed and design accuracy.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Exact visual match to Swiss banking standards
- Maintainable CSS architecture with variables
- Rapid development through utility classes

**Negative:**
- Custom design system requires ongoing maintenance
- Limited to Swiss design aesthetic

## 2024-12-15: Clean Architecture with 300-Line File Limit

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Implement clean architecture principles with strict 300-line file size limit, separating concerns into Controllers, Services, Models, and Middleware layers.

### Context

Previous monolithic approach led to maintainability issues and difficulty in testing. Need modular, testable architecture that supports long-term maintenance.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Monolithic file structure**
   - Pros: Simpler initial development
   - Cons: Difficult to maintain, test, and scale

2. **Microservices architecture**
   - Pros: Ultimate modularity
   - Cons: Over-engineering for current scale, increased complexity

### Rationale

Clean architecture with file size limits provides optimal balance of modularity, testability, and maintainability without over-engineering.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Highly maintainable and testable codebase
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier onboarding for new developers
- Reduced technical debt

**Negative:**
- Initial development overhead to establish patterns
- Strict discipline required to maintain architecture

## 2024-11-20: Role-Based Architecture Optimization

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, UX Designer, Development Team

### Decision

Optimize application architecture around three distinct user roles (User, Admin, Super Admin) with 80% development focus on User role functionality.

### Context

Swiss banking organizations have clear hierarchical structures with different needs at each level. User role represents 80% of system usage and should receive primary development attention.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **One-size-fits-all interface**
   - Pros: Simpler development and maintenance
   - Cons: Poor user experience, feature bloat for basic users

2. **Completely separate applications per role**
   - Pros: Highly optimized for each role
   - Cons: Code duplication, complex deployment and maintenance

### Rationale

Role-based architecture with shared codebase and optimized interfaces provides best user experience while maintaining code efficiency.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Optimal user experience for each role
- Clear development priorities
- Reduced cognitive load for users
- Improved task completion efficiency

**Negative:**
- More complex navigation logic
- Role-specific testing requirements

## 2024-10-15: Vanilla JavaScript with ES6 Modules

**ID:** DEC-005
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Frontend Developer

### Decision

Use Vanilla JavaScript with ES6 modules instead of frontend frameworks (React, Vue, Angular) for the user interface implementation.

### Context

Project requires lightweight, fast-loading interface with minimal complexity. Team expertise is strong in vanilla JavaScript. No complex state management needs identified.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **React with build pipeline**
   - Pros: Modern development experience, large ecosystem
   - Cons: Build complexity, larger bundle size, learning curve

2. **Vue.js**
   - Pros: Easier learning curve than React
   - Cons: Still requires build pipeline, additional framework dependency

### Rationale

Vanilla JavaScript with ES6 modules provides optimal performance, simplicity, and maintainability for the project's requirements without framework overhead.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Fastest possible loading times
- No build pipeline complexity
- Direct browser support
- Easier debugging and maintenance
- No framework version upgrade concerns

**Negative:**
- More manual DOM manipulation code
- No framework-provided state management patterns
- Potentially more verbose code for complex interactions
